<ul>
	<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1">Our currency has a target block generation rate&#42;</li>
	<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2">This impacts both the rate at which we can transact... <span class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3">and the rate that new coins are minted</span></li>
	<li class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4">So, periodically, we adjust target difficulty, based on whether we're over or under performing&#8224;</li>
</ul>
