## Wallets & Keys

<ul>
	<li class="fragment">"Wallets" are basically just <span class="green">public</span>/<span class="red">private</span> key pairs</li>
	<li class="fragment">Funds are sent <em>to</em> your wallet's address or <span class="green">public key</span></li>
	<li class="fragment">Funds are sent <em>from</em> your wallet by signing a transaction with your <span class="red">private key</span></li>
	<li class="fragment">If someone can access your <span class="red">private key</span>, it's like them having your cash</li>
