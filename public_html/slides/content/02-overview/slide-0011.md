## Network Difficulty Example
<div>
	Let's say it's early in our blockchain's existence. There are few miners, so we'll say target difficulty is 4 zeros.
	Call the transactional + metadata in our block <em>B</em>, our nonce <em>n</em>, and the hash function &fnof;.  We'll try different nonces, to hit our target,
	calculating<br>&fnof;<em>(B + n)</em>
