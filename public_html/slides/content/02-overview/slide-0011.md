## Network Difficulty Example
<div class="fragment current-visible">
	Let's say it's early in our blockchain's existence. There are few miners, so difficulty is low.  Let's say we want 4 zeros.
	Let's just call the transactional + metadata in our block "B", and our nonce "n".  We'll try different nonces, to hit our target,
	calculating hash(B + n).
